Before it was solved, people had to convey keys on a sheet of paper as during the Second World War. In 1976 breakthrough happened when an American cryptographer Whitfield Diffie together with his colleague, professor of Stanford University, Martin Hellman published key exchange scheme which later became known as **the Diffie-Hellman protocol**. Actually, neither Alice nor Bob doesn't transmit a secret key at all, but the key is generated on both sides just by the simple mathematical trick. This absolutely brilliant and simple solution made a real revolution in the world of encryption and launched a whole direction in cryptography called asymmetric cryptography (or public-key cryptography). So how can Alice and Bob get the same keys without passing them to each other?\n\n<Math>(x^y)^z = x^{yz} = (x^z)^y</Math>\n\nThis expression is also valid for modular arithmetic which is the base for all cryptography schemes today. So you have to be familiar enough with this branch of math to understand how most of the ciphers work.\n\nTo get the same key on both sides:"}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"Article_5cc608b9460d3900642eee3b"}}
